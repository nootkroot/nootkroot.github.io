# Hi, I'm nootkroot (A.K.A. kroot)
I do [CTFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) with ARESx, ITDWWGMFNY/Friendly Maltese Citizens, and sometimes my high school team sl1th3r.

Interests:
- Binary Exploitation
- Reverse Engineering
- Networking (CCNA)
- Programming
- Other stuff :P

This is just a blog where I'll mostly be posting writeups from CTFs that I do, but maybe also other things I find interesting.

Now that you're here, why not read some of my [posts](/posts)?
