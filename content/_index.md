# Hi, I'm nootkroot (A.K.A. kroot)
I do [CTFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) with ARESx and sometimes my high school team sl1th3r.

I mainly focus on binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and other miscellaneous topics.

I like to code in:
- Python
- C
- Golang

but I'm able to use others when needed.

I've been programming since mid-2020 and doing cybersecurity and CTFs since early-2022.

This is just a blog where I'll mostly be posting writeups from CTFs that I do, but maybe also other things I find interesting.

Now that you're here, why not read some of my [posts](/posts)?
