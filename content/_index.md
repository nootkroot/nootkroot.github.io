# Hi, I'm nootkroot (A.K.A. kroot)
I do [CTFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) with ARESx and sometimes my high school team sl1th3r.

I mainly focus on binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and other miscellaneous topics.

I like to code in:
- Python
- C
- Golang

but I'm able to use others when needed.

I've been programming since mid-2020 and cybersecurity since early-2022.

This is my blog where I'll mostly be posting writeups from CTFs that I do, but maybe also other things I find interesting.

## Education
I'm currently a sophomore at Interlake High School.

I'm also studying for my CCNA and am pursuing the CCNP and OSED certifications.

## Projects
I'm building my own CTF platform, although very far from being done and still only a concept as of now.

## Awards
- 2nd place Cybersecurity @ State ([TSA 2022](https://tsaweb.org/))
- 2nd place Cybersecurity @ Nationals ([TSA 2022](https://tsaweb.org/))
- 1st place in national Jewish entrepreneurship competition ([IAC Eitanim 2022](https://iac360.org/eitanim/))
  - Got a tour of the UN and met the Israeli ambassador to the UN

Now that you're here, why not read some of my [posts](/posts)?
